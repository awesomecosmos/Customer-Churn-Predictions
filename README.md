# Customer Churn Predictions in the Telecommunications Industry

**by Aayushi Verma**

The aim of this project is to perform a deep-dive EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on a dataset and to build machine learning models for the dataset and evaluate the models. We will start by examining the raw dataset, cleaning it, visualizing it, preparing it for feeding into a machine learning model, building machine learning models for the dataset and evaluating the models. We will meaningful results from the models.

The dataset is a CSV file containing data about customer churn from the telecommunication industry. Churn is an important metric for businesses to analyze because high churn rates indicate unsatisfied customers, whereas low churn rates indicate satisfied customers, i.e. customers are less likely to leave this company and take their business elsewhere. Therefore it is important for companies to be able to understand their churn rates, predict future churn rates, and optimize their services to have continuing low churn rates.

This project is adapted from a class project for my Pace University MS in Data Science course CS675 Introduction to Data Science. The repository for my class project code is available on my Github at: https://github.com/awesomecosmos/CS675-Intro-To-Data-Science. The dataset is provided by the Professor, and so there is no direct source for it.

I have also recorded some videos of the code walkthroughs for the class project:
